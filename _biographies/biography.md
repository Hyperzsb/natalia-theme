I studied as an undergraduate at [Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)](https://bit.edu.cn/) majoring in Computer Science and Technology from 2018 to 2022.
Right now I am pursuing my Master's degree at [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) with specialization in Information Security.

I have fundamental knowledge in frontend and backend development and basic skills in the server (cloud and on-premise) setup & maintenance.
I also use DevOps and automation techniques to facilitate my study and work.

After doing some research and experiments on Cybersecurity and Blockchain, I began to study further into these fields, believing that security will become the first priority in the future industry.
