Vladimir is a landing theme for almost any project with demo and documentation supports based on Vue.js.

## Special Notes

As this project is an early project of mine (quite simple and crude), and it is based on version 2.x of Vue (whose latest version is version 3.x), this project may not be updated anymore.

This project is only used for learning purpose. **DO NOT** use it in production environments in case of potential security issues of the project's legacy dependencies.
